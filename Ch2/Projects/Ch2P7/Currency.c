// Write a program that asks the user to enter a U.S. dollar amount and then shows how to pay
// that amount using the smallest number of $20. $10. $5. and $1 bills:
// Enter a dollar amount: 2;
// $20 bills: 4
// $10 bills: 1
// $5 bills: 0
// $1 bills: 3
// Hint: Divide the amount by 20 to determine the number of $20 bills needed. and then reduce
// the amount by the total value of the $20 bills. Repeat for the other bill sizes. Be sure to use
// integer values throughout. not floatingâ€”point numbers.
